## Features

- Displays car information such as ID, make, model, type, and year.
- Stylish and responsive user interface with a background image and overlay effect.
- Hover effect on car information items to enhance user interaction.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- [Car Data API](https://rapidapi.com/apis/car-data) for car information
- GitHub Pages for hosting

## How It Works

1. The app sends an API request to fetch car data.
2. Upon successful response, it displays the car information such as ID, make, model, type, and year in a list.
3. The page is styled with a background image and a semi-transparent overlay to make the car information stand out.
4. Each list item has a hover effect for a more interactive experience.
